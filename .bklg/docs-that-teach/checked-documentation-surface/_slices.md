# Slice ledger — The Checked Documentation Surface

The review verdict of every vertical slice of this project, sealed as it closed.

A slice's stories commit BEFORE its adversarial review runs, so "committed" is not "approved".
This ledger is the second axis: it records which slices actually cleared review, so a re-launched
implement run re-reviews a rejected slice instead of walking past it as finished. Each row is sealed
by a commit carrying a `Slice-Verdict: <project-slug>/<slice> <verdict>` trailer — the ledger is the
human-readable record, the trailer is what resume greps.

## Verdicts

| Slice | Verdict | Story checkpoints | Sealed by |
| ----- | ------- | ----------------- | --------- |
|       |         |                   |           |

## Surviving findings

For each slice whose verdict is `changes-requested`, the findings that survived the in-slice fix
pass, with the `file:line` evidence the reviewer cited. These are the prescription a resumed run —
or a human — starts from. They are hypotheses for the next reviewer to verify, not facts to trust.
